# Forecasting-Technical-Support-and-New-Support-Calls
This is one of my final projects for forecasting which included some comprehensive forecasting problems such as forecasting both technical support calls and new support calls for a call center. In this project, I utilized a time series forecast and compared various methods and their performances in order to determine the most suitable forecasting method for each scenario. I explored all of the forecasting methods such as naive forecasts, exponential smoothing, ARIMA modelling, and multiple linear regression as well as different statistical tests and models. Furthermore, I also performed decomposition analysis for the time series, outlier analysis, and data manipulation such as one hot encoding.
